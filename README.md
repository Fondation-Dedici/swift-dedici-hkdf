# DediciHKDF

This package is a basic HKDF utility and was made in context of the development of the [Dediĉi_code project (fr)](https://www.dedici.org/dedici_code). Since the begining of the development of the library, there is now a HKDF utility in swift-crypto/CryptoKit. However, this specific implementation allows the use of the TextSecureV2 version which is still required for some of the related projects.

⚠️ Warning: Please do not use this package in any of your production projects as it is not yet ready for production. This package still needs more tests and reviews.
